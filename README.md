# Whatsapp-Integration

Document: Steps to Send a WhatsApp Message from Your
Application :

1. Choose the Right Method for Integration

To send WhatsApp messages from your application, you can either use:

 WhatsApp Business API: Provided oﬃcially by Meta (parent company of WhatsApp). It’s
suitable for medium to large businesses.

 Third-Party Services: Platforms like Twilio, MessageBird, or RapidAPI simplify the integration
by providing pre-built solutions.


2. Pre-requisites for Setup
 WhatsApp Business Account:
o Register your business on Facebook Business Manager. 
o Get your business verified (this is mandatory for the WhatsApp Business API).

 Phone Number:
o A dedicated phone number that is not already linked to another WhatsApp account.

 Hosting Environment:
o For the WhatsApp Business API, you need a server to host the API client.
o For third-party services, no hosting is required as they manage the backend.

3. Obtain API Credentials:

 For WhatsApp Business API:
o Request API access from Meta or use a Business Solution Provider (BSP).
o Install the API client (Docker container).
o Retrieve your API keys or tokens.

 For Third-Party Providers:
o Sign up and generate your API key (e.g., Twilio Account SID and Auth Token).

4. Code Implementation
Write code to send a message using the API of your choice. Below is an example for Twilio:

import com.twilio.Twilio;
import com.twilio.rest.api.v2010.account.Message;
import com.twilio.type.PhoneNumber;
public class WhatsAppMessageSender {
// Twilio credenƟals
public staƟc final String ACCOUNT
SID =
_
public staƟc final String AUTH
TOKEN =
_
"your
"your
account
_
_
sid";
auth
token";
_
_
public staƟc void main(String[] args) {
Twilio.init(ACCOUNT
_
SID, AUTH
_
TOKEN);
// Send a WhatsApp message
Message message = Message.creator(
new PhoneNumber("whatsapp:+1234567890"),
new PhoneNumber("whatsapp:+14155238886"),
"Hello! This is a test message from my app.
"
).create();
System.out.println("Message sent with SID: " + message.getSid());
}
}


6. Testing

 Use the sandbox environment provided by the service (e.g., Twilio Sandbox for
WhatsApp) for testing.

 Verify message delivery and error handling.

7. Deploy to ProducƟon

 Switch from sandbox to the production environment. 

 Ensure that your application complies with WhatsApp’s message template policies (required
for non-transactional messages).

8. Monitor and Handle Errors
 Implement logging for sent messages. 
 Handle API errors such as invalid numbers, quota exceeded, etc.

Additional Notes:

 Costs: Sending WhatsApp messages involves costs. Check the pricing on the oﬃcial Meta or
third-party provider’s website.

 Templates: For non-transactional messages, pre-approved templates are required by
WhatsApp.
